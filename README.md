# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-
SQL Data Analysis Project
Overview

This project demonstrates the complete process of working with raw data, from importing a CSV file into SQL Server to performing structured analysis through queries. The objective was to create a relational database from a flat file and then use SQL to answer ten business-related questions. This exercise helped strengthen my understanding of database design, data cleaning, and query writing while simulating the type of work done in real-world analytics projects.

Tools and Technologies

SQL Server

CSV dataset (imported and converted into SQL tables)

Process

Imported the CSV file into SQL Server and created a database.

Designed and structured the database with appropriate tables and data types.

Performed basic cleaning and transformations to ensure consistency in the dataset.

Developed SQL queries to explore and analyze the data.

Answered ten questions that focused on identifying trends, performance metrics, and other insights.

Key Concepts Practiced

Database creation and schema design

Data cleaning and preparation within SQL

Aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX

Use of GROUP BY and ORDER BY for summarizing data

Filtering using WHERE and HAVING clauses

Applying different types of JOINs to combine data from multiple tables

Repository Structure

Database_Script.sql – Script used to create the database and tables.

SQL Queries.sql – Contains all SQL queries written to answer the ten business questions.

Pizza Sales Analysis Report – A written summary of the answers and insights generated from the analysis.

Outcome

By the end of the project, I was able to take a raw CSV file, convert it into a structured SQL database, and extract meaningful insights using queries. The analysis covered ten different business questions, showcasing the ability to apply SQL techniques to real datasets. This project reflects my capability to handle end-to-end SQL analysis tasks, from database setup to insight generation, and serves as a foundation for more advanced analytics work.
